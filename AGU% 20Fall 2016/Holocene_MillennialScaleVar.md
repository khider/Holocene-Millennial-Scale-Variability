# Testing the Millennial-Scale Holocene Solar-Climate Connection in the Indo-Pacific Warm Pool

## Motivation

<p>The existence of 1000 and 2500-year periodicities found in reconstructions of total solar irradiance (TSI) and a number of Holocene climate records has led to the hypothesis of a causal relationship<sup>[1-3]</sup>. However, attributing millennial-scale variability to solar forcing requires a mechanism by which small changes in total solar irradiance can influence a global climate response. One possible amplifier within the climate system is the ocean. If this is the case, then we need to know about where and how this may be occurring. On the other hand, the similarity in spectral peaks could be merely coincidental, and this should be made apparent by a lack of coherence in how that power and phasing are distributed in time and space.</p>

<p style="font-weight: bold"> The plausibility of the solar forcing hypothesis is assessed trough a Bayesian model of the age uncertainties affecting marine sedimentary records that is propagated through spectral analysis of the climate and forcing signals at key frequencies<sup>[4]</sup>.</p>

## Methods

## Age model

The age models for each of the sedimentary records considered in this study were obtained using the Bchron software<sup>[5]</sup>. Bchron returns ensemble age models that take into consideration the uncertainty in the radiocarbon measurements, in the calibration curve, and in the reservoir age of the ocean.

Bchron was originally coded in the R language. Since Jupyter Notebook allows to switch between the Python and R (even Matlab, see below) languages easily using <a href='https://ipython.org/ipython-doc/3/interactive/magics.html'>cell magics</a>, these codes can be reused without any modifications within the same environment.

## Spectral Analysis
### Lomb-Scargle Periodogram
Holocene periodicities were inferred from the Lomb-Scargle periodogram<sup>[6]</sup>, which allows to handle unevenly-spaced timeseries, for each of the age model realizations (n=1000) returned by Bchron. We then identified the maximum peak within the 900-1200 year band, the 1200-2000 year band, and the 2000-3000 year band if present. The median periodicity is calculated at the median of the peak periodicities thus identified while the highest density region represents the 95% confidence interval on the peak periodicities.

<p>Standard adoption also allows to build codes for the community by the community. The LinkedEarth team is currently building Python and R packages for the analysis of paleoclimate data.</p>

### Cross-Wavelet Analysis
We performed cross-wavelet analysis<sup>[7]</sup> between each realization of the sedimentary records and the TSI record of ref 9. Since the cross-wavelet analysis code was written in the Matlab language, we use pymatbridge to run a m-file within the Python environment (see the code below).

So far, this Notebook has made use of Python, R, and Matlab codes.

```python
# Get a Matlab session started
from pymatbridge import Matlab
mlab = Matlab()

mlab = Matlab(executable='/Applications/MATLAB_R2016a.app/bin/matlab')

mlab.start()
```

## Results
### Holocene Periodicities within the Indo-Pacific Warm Pool
The median periodicity is expressed as the median peak of the ensemble spectra while the highest density region (HDR) represents the 95% confidence interval on the ensemble spectra.
#### 900-1200-yr band

![png](output_11_1.png)


Mean periodicity &#177; standard error = 1022 &#177; 27 years.

#### 1200-2000-yr band

![png](output_14_2.png)


Mean periodicity &#177; standard error = 1486 &#177; 96 years.

#### 2000-3000 yr band

![png](output_16_2.png)


Mean periodicity &#177; standard error = 2391 &#177; 138 years.

<p>Despite large uncertainties in the location of the spectral peak within each individual record arising from age model uncertainty, sea surface variability of ~1000 years, ~1500 years, and ~2500 years are present in at least 70-95% of the ensemble spectra.</p>

<p> Remarkably, all records suggest a periodicity near ~1500 years, reminiscent of the cycles characteristic of Marine Isotope Stage 3<sup>[8]</sup>. These cycles are absent from existing records of TSI<sup>[9]</sup>, questioning the millennial-scale solar-climate connection.</p>

### The role of the sun

![png](output_18_1.png)

<p>The mean phase &#177; standard deviation is -17&#177;55&#176; for the periodicity centered around ~1000 years and 10&#177;97&#176; for the periodicity centered around ~2500 years.</p>

## Key points
<ol>
<li> The large age model uncertainty inherent to paleoceanographic reconstructions prevents meaningful analysis of periodicities from one single record. </li>
<li> Synthesis of multple records suggests robust periodicities centered around ~1000 years, ~1500 years and ~2500 years in sea surface temperature variability within the Indo-Pacific Warm Pool. </li>
</br>
<p style="font-weight:bold"> We cannot discard the possibility that the sun might have paced millennial-scale climate variability over the Holocene. </p>
</br>
<li> Refuting or accepting the solar forcing hypothesis will require additional records with a global coverage.</li>
<li> LinkedEarth aims to facilitate synthesis work to answer pressing questions in paleoclimatology. </li>
</ol>

## Future Work
<ol>
<li> <b>Expand the database</b> to global coverage. </li>
<li> <b>Explore lead-lag relationships</b> among various regions. </li>
<li> <b>Estimate magnitude</b> of millennial-scale variability. </li>
</ol>

## LinkedEarth and the future of paleoclimatology
<ul>
<li> <b>Crowdsource data curation</b> though a wiki platform. </li>
<li> <b> Develop web standards</b> for paleoclimate observations. </li>
<li> <b> Develop social codes</b> to accelerate scientific discovery. </li>
</ul>

<p style="font-weight:bold"> The ultimate goal of LinkedEarth is to allow scientists to spend more time on science, less on issues computers can solve. </p>
