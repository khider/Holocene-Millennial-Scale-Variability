A solar forcing hypothesis is often put forward in the literature to explain the 1000 and 2500-year periodicities found in a number of Holocene climate archives because of similarities between the spectral peaks in the proxy records and reconstructions of solar variability. However, attributing Holocene millennial-scale variability to solar forcing requires a mechanism by which small changes in total irradiance can influence a global climate response. One possible amplifier within the climate system is the ocean. If this is the case, then we need to know more about where and how this may be occurring. On the other hand, the similarity in spectral peaks could be merely coincidental, and this should be made apparent by a lack of coherence in how that power and phasing is distributed in time and space.

The plausibility of the solar forcing hypothesis is assessed through a Bayesian model of the age uncertainties affecting marine sedimentary records that is propagated through spectral analyses and decomposition of the climate and forcing signals at particular frequencies. Preliminary work on Mg/Ca and alkenone records from the Indo-Pacific Warm Pool suggests that despite large uncertainties in the location of the spectral peaks within each individual record arising from age model uncertainty, sea surface variability on timescales of 1025±36 years and 2427±133 years (±standard error of the mean of the median periodicity in each record) are consistently present in at least 95% and 70% of the ensemble spectra respectively. However, we find a long phase delay between the peak in forcing and the maximum response in at least one of the records, challenging the solar forcing hypothesis and requiring further investigation between low- and high-latitude signals.

Furthermore, all records also suggest a periodicity centered around 1470±85 years, reminiscent of the cycles characteristic of Marine Isotope Stage 3 and which cannot be directly attributed to solar variability.
